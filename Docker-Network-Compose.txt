1)What is docker-Network?
-->allows users to connect Docker containers to networks and communicate with them
---------- 7 types of network-----------
-Bridge networks: Used within a single host.
-Overlay networks: Used for communication between multiple hosts. 
-Macvlan networks: Used to connect Docker containers directly to host network interfaces.
-IPvLAN: Provides full control over IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
-None: Completely isolates a container from the host and other containers.
-Mesos: server and client to control container networking
-Host: Containers that use the host network mode share the host's network stack without isolation

2)What is docker-Compose?
--->a tool that helps to run multi-container applications on Docker.Spin up & spin down
#sudo yum install docker -y
#sudo systemctl start docker
#sudo systemctl enable docker 
#sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose 
#sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
#docker-compose --version
